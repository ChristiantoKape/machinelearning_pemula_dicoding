# Proyek Klasifikasi Gambar Rock, Paper, Scissors ðŸ‘ŠðŸ¤šâœŒ

## Name : Christianto Kurniawan Priyono

### Description
------------------------------------------------------------
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to distinguish rock-paper-scissors hand movements in images.
This project is a submission for the [Belajar Machine Learning untuk Pemula](https://www.dicoding.com/academies/184) course on Dicoding.

### Features
------------------------------------------------------------
- ImageDataGenerator is used to prepare training data and validation data.
- Convolutional Neural Network for image classification.
- Simple interface for uploading images and getting predictions.

### Getting Started
------------------------------------------------------------
Follow these steps to run the project on Google Colab:
1. Open Google Colab.
2. Click on File > Open notebook.
3. Choose the GitHub tab and enter the repository URL: https://github.com/ChristiantoKape/machinelearning_pemula_dicoding
4. Select the ```ML_Pemula_Christianto_Kurniawan.ipynb``` notebook.
5. Run each code cell sequentially to train the model and make predictions.

### Learning Evaluation
------------------------------------------------------------
This submission received 4/5 stars with the following evaluation:
1.  Has not implemented other techniques not taught, such as dropout, plot, callback, and so on. However, **the improvement has already** incorporated the application of callback techniques.
2. Data Augmentation on validation data should not be used to increase data and produce different images. **The correction has** been made by removing Data Augmentation on validation data.

### Certificate
